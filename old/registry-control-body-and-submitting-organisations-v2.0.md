## Background

The INSPIRE infrastructure involves several items, which require clear descriptions and the possibility to be referenced through unique identifiers. Registers provide a means to assign identifiers to items and their labels, definitions and descriptions (in different languages).

The [INSPIRE registry](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/registry) provides a central access point to several centrally managed INSPIRE registers based on the [ISO 19135-1 standard “Geographic information - Procedures for item registration”](https://www.iso.org/standard/54721.html). This ISO standard defines a management process to handle change proposals to the registry contents (including registers and register items) involving multiple roles that have different responsibilities in the registers’ lifecycle and register items.

During the [34th MIG-T meeting](https://wayback.archive-it.org/12090/20201222012329/https:/ies-svn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/mig-inspire/wiki/MIG-T_meeting_34), the following roles were agreed for the INSPIRE registry:

-   Register owner: EU  
-   Register & registry manager: JRC
-   Submitting organisations: [One or two per country (MIG-T or other nominated representative) and INSPIRE Coordination Team (AGRI, EEA, ENV, ESTAT and JRC)](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-registry/blob/main/submitting-organisations-list.md)
-   Control body:  [Small group of nominated register experts](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-registry/blob/main/control-body-list.md)
-   Register user: anyone    

This document sets the terms of reference for the control body and submitting organisations for the INSPIRE registry.

There should be one submitting organisation per country in addition to the INSPIRE Coordination Team. The submitting organisation representative submits proposals for changes to the register manager, who will process them and forward them to the control body for decision before proceeding to the implementation.

The control body should be a small group of technical experts appointed by the register owner to decide on the acceptability of proposals for changes to a register’s content. To keep the burden for the control body to a minimum, it is proposed to only consult it on major issues. Minor issues (such as correction of minor bugs) will be implemented directly by the register manager (JRC).

All changes are publicly documented. If a submitting organisation or control body representatives objects to a change made by the register manager, the issue shall be discussed and resolved in the [INSPIRE registry helpdesk GitHub space.](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-registry/blob/main/submitting-organisations-list.md)

The control body may also “escalate” issues to the MIG that may have far-reaching consequences for INSPIRE implementation in the Member States. In this case, the control body should inform DG ENV about these issues and request to add this issue to the next meeting agenda

## Terms of reference for the control body for the INSPIRE registry

 1.  The task of the control body for the INSPIRE registry, hereinafter referred to as “the control body”, shall be to review and accept or reject proposals for changes to the content of the central INSPIRE registers.  In particular, the control body shall
	 *  review proposals submitted to the control body by the register manager and check whether they are consistent with the INSPIRE rules (e.g. the extensibility specified in the related INSPIRE registers).
	 *  decide on the acceptability of the submitted proposals. The decision shall be one of the following:
		  *  accept the proposal without change
		  *  accept the proposal subject to changes negotiated with the submitting organisation
		  * reject the proposal
       *  revisit, on request of a submitting organisation or a control body representatives, minor changes accepted by the register manager without consulting the control body.

2.  The control body is expected to be active until 2024-12-31 in alignment with the [INSPIRE work programme 2021-24](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/INSPIRE+work+programme+2021-24).  After this time, its operation shall be reviewed by the MIG and its term may be extended.
3.  The control body shall be chaired by the European Commission.
4.  The control body shall regularly inform the MIG about its progress and can request guidance from the MIG when needed,  particularly for issues, that may have far-reaching consequences for INSPIRE implementation in the Member States.
5.  Secretarial services shall be provided by the Joint Research Centre.
6.  In order to cut down costs and commitments, the meetings of the control body should, where possible, be organised virtually (i.e. using tele-, video-, or web-conferencing facilities).
7.  The physical and intellectual products generated by the representatives of the control body under these terms of reference will remain the property of the Commission. Any published deliverable or paper will acknowledge the authorship and other contributions of the control body representatives. Such deliverables or papers will be made available in accordance with the European Commission Decision of 12 December 2011 on re-use of Commission documents, without restrictions on access and re-use for commercial and non-commercial purposes.
8.  The control  body  will be using the [GitHub platform for discussing issues](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-registry/issues) and the INSPIRE Registry for assessing proposals. Personal data in these systems will be collected in accordance with the GDPR ([GitHub's privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement)) and Regulation 2018/1725 ([INSPIRE's privacy policy](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/privacy-policy/59294))
9.  Representatives for the control body can be proposed using  [this issue template](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-registry/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=nominate-control-body.md&title=) on GitHub. The list of [control body representatives](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-registry/blob/main/control-body-list.md) will be maintained on GitHub.
10.  Representatives of the control body shall not be remunerated for the services they render.

## Terms of reference for the submitting organisations for the INSPIRE registry

1.  The tasks of the submitting organisations for the INSPIRE registry, hereinafter referred to as “submitting organisations", shall be to
    *  collect, consolidate and submit proposals for changes to the content of the central INSPIRE registers  to the register manager;
    * ensure that proposals are well drafted and complete;
	*  ensure that proposals have been agreed and consolidated at national level (for MS submitting organisations), inside the thematic communities, inside the Commission (for DG ENV and JRC) or inside the EEA/EIONET network (for EEA);
	*  provide clarifications about proposals to the register manager or register owner, if necessary.
2.  The submitting organisations  are expected to be  active until 2024-12-31 in alignment with the [INSPIRE work programme 2021-24](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/INSPIRE+work+programme+2021-24). After this time, its operation shall be reviewed by the MIG and its term may be extended.
3.  Each country represented in the MIG shall nominate a submitting organisation, typically an organisation representing the country in the MIG-T or another organisation involved in the coordination of the INSPIRE implementation in that country. In addition, the members of the INSPIRE Coordination Team (Directorates General AGRI, ENV, ESTAT, JRC, and the EEA) shall be submitting organisations.
4.  Representatives for the  submitting organisation  can be proposed by using  the dedicated [issue template on the related GitHub space](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-registry/issues/new?assignees=&labels=submitting+organisation+nomination&template=nominate-submitting-organisation.md&title=).  The list of [representatives](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-registry/blob/main/submitting-organisations-list.md) will be maintained on GitHub.
5.  The submitting organisation representatives will be using the [GitHub platform for discussions](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/helpdesk-registry/issues) and the INSPIRE Registry for proposing change proposals. Personal data in these systems will be collected in accordance with the GDPR ([GitHub's privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement)) and Regulation 2018/1725 ([INSPIRE's privacy policy](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/privacy-policy/59294)).
6.  Representatives of the submitting organisations shall not be remunerated for the services they render.
